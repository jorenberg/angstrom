## How to publishing packages to npm and bower?

1. To publish, you must have a user on the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) registry. If you donâ€™t have one, create it with `npm adduser`. If you created one on the site, use `npm login` to store the credentials on the client.
2. Publishing packages to [Bower](http://bower.io/) is very similar to publishing to npm. On creating and publishing packages to Bower, check out the [documentation](http://bower.io/docs/creating-packages/) and the `bower.json` [specifications](https://github.com/bower/spec).
