## About
While, I was working to build NobelDB — a manually curated dedicated database of nobel laureates; I was applied some declarations to respond the whole project on different breakpoint(s) for desktop, tablet, and mobile. And, I was not able to fit the entire working Front-End in that way. Then, I have started this project to work on the same order to do so. Cool<i>!</i>

This, project is a spun-off of NobelDB, right. It is a semantic, modular, and modern responsive Sass based with flavour of `.scss`, breakpoint based on W3C international standards.

### What's inside?
A lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser above and see what components may mesh up with you. I have written some class(s) to work for responsiveness and to work on the principle of progressive enhancement. All Ångström® is build for every layout, whatever in the daily use by the help of Sass and JavaScript.

<b>Note</b>: Fork it, remove what you don't use, and build on what you do use.
