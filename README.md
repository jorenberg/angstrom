## About
While, I was working to build NobelDB — a manually curated dedicated database of nobel laureates; I was applied some declarations to respond the whole project on different breakpoint(s) for desktop, tablet, and mobile. And, I was not able to fit the entire working Front-End in that way. Then, I have started this project to work on the same order to do so. Cool<i>!</i>

This, project is a spun-off of NobelDB, right. It is a semantic, modular, and modern responsive Sass based with flavour of `.scss`, breakpoint based on W3C international standards.
