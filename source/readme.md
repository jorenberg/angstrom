### Sass [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sass.png)](https://rubygems.org/gems/sass)
**Sass makes CSS fun again**. Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.
It's translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin.

Sass has two syntaxes. The new main syntax (as of Sass 3) is known as "SCSS" (for "Sassy CSS"), and is a superset of CSS's syntax.
This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is valid SCSS as well. SCSS files use the extension `.scss`.
